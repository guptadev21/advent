# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to the **Advent of Code** solutions repository! 🎄✨

This repository contains my solutions for the challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual coding event held during December. Each day features a fun and unique problem-solving exercise that combines programming, algorithms, and creativity.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by day, with each day's folder containing:
- `README.md`: Explanation of the day's problem.
- `solution.py`: My Python implementation of the solution.
- `input.txt`: The puzzle input provided for that day.
- `example_input.txt`: (Optional) Example input used for testing.
